# Predict_3ptContest_Participants
Since a Japanese NBA player, Yuta Watanabe, is ranking top in terms of 3pt percentage in this season, I am interested in the participants in this year's 3 point contest. As of mid of Janualy 2023, I would like to predict the candidates, extracting data by nba_api and using Machine Learning model for classification such as Logistic Regression and SVM.
