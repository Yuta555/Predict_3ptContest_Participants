# Predict_3ptContest_Participants
Since a Japanese NBA player, Yuta Watanabe, has ranked top in 3pt percentage in this season, I am interested in the participants in this year's 3 point contest. As of end of Janualy 2023, I would like to predict the candidates, extracting data by [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) and using Machine Learning techniques for classification from traditional models like Logistic Regression and SVM to Boosting/Stacking methods.

The techniques I used are below.

* Traditional Machine Learning Models
* Boosting 
* Stacking
